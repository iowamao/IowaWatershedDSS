        <h2>About IoWaDSS</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Recent Iowa Watershed efforts have one central commonality: they address the water quantity and quality issues using a watershed approach.  Progressive watershed organizational and improvement programs have produced a vast amount of resources in the form of data, information and knowledge on water resources management that are currently residing in different repositories. The Iowa Watershed Decision Support System (IoWaDSS), a project funded by the US Army Corps of Engineers’ Institute for Water Resources, aims at assembling data, tools, and models in one geo-portal to efficiently inform watershed stakeholders on current status and future of Iowa watersheds as well as to assess alternative strategies for sustainable watershed resources across multiple spatio-temporal scales.</p>

        <h2>Iowa Watershed Efforts</h2>
        <hr>
        <p><img src="img/about-efforts.jpg" id="img1" width="300">Since 2009, the Iowa-Cedar Watershed Interagency Coordination Team spearheads a cross-jurisdictional effort for enhancing interagency collaboration and public participation to address watershed issues in Iowa, by increasing social and economic values, ecological integrity, and managing risks. In the same year, the state of Iowa established and funded the Iowa Flood Center to enhance research and education on floods. In parallel, academic researchers at the University of Iowa’s IIHR-Hydroscience & Engineering and the Center for Global and Regional Environmental Research have tackled complex issues of water quality in Iowa’s agricultural watersheds with support from the National Science Foundation.  In 2010, Iowa lawmakers passed legislation authorizing the creation of Watershed Management Authorities as local mechanisms for cooperatively engaging local stakeholders in watershed planning and management. Starting with 2016, the State of Iowa has initiated the Iowa Watershed Approach program with funding from the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development to allow Iowans to work together for addressing flood risk and water quality.</p>

        <h2>Iowa Watershed History</h2>
        <hr>
        <p><img src="img/about-history.jpg" id="img2" width="300">The industrialization of agriculture has continuously benefited Iowans since the late 19th century. While transforming Iowa into an agricultural powerhouse, the movement  of water within the watersheds continues to alter the landscape, reducing its natural resiliency. Iowa’s current hydrology has been drastically changed impacting peak water flows, flooding, and water quality, especially during extreme weather events. As a result of landscape changes, flooding risks are heightened and the water quality is degrading affecting drinking water supplies, recreation, tourism, and biotic diversity.</p>
